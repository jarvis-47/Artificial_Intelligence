# CPSC 6420 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence. Specific topics include uninformed and informed search techniques, game playing, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, uncertain knowledge and probabilistic reasoning, constraint satisfaction problems, and supervised learning. 

## Topics Covered:
1. Search
   ○ Uninformed search: depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform cost search
   ○ Informed search: greedy search, A*, heuristics
   ○ A* and autonomous navigation
2. Game Playing
   ○ Minimax, alpha-beta pruning and Expectimax
3. Constraint Satisfaction Problems
   ○ The map coloring problem
   ○ Backtracking search, arc consistency, dynamic ordering
   ○ Local search
4. Markov Decision Processes
   ○ Value iteration
   ○ Policy evaluation
   ○ Policy iteration
5. Reinforcement Learning
   ○ Temporal difference learning / Q-learning
   ○ Function approximation
6. Uncertain Knowledge and Probabilistic Reasoning
   ○ Probabilities, Bayes rule
